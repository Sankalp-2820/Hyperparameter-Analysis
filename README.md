# Hyperparameter-Analysis on Performance of Neural Networks
**Analysis of the effect of Hyper-parameter tuning on Neural Network Model**
- Creating a Simple Neural Network to classify digits from 0-9 using
  **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**(for PCA).
- Use of the **MNIST** data set (available on Kaggle) to train the model.
- Testing the accuracy of the model by tuning different Hyperparameters.
- **Hyperparameters** - Epochs, Batch_size, Learning Rate, No. of Layers,
  Activation functions, No. of Neurons and Optimisers(Adam/Classic)
- Analysis of results to find the best set of Hyperparameters to maximise
  the accuracy of the digit-classifier model.
